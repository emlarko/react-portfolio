The User viewing this portfolio will find an about me page first, which is set as the default page, with an image and a short bio.

When navigating to the portfolio page from the header, they will find images of previous projects, each with a short description and links to the repo and live site. 

On the contact page, there is a form that can be filled out. If the email is invalid, a name is not entered or a query is not inputted, an error message appears when the User clicks off the box. 

When visiting the Resume page, the User will be able to view a set of my skills and will be able to download a copy of my CV.

## Roadmap

The contact form cannot be submitted as the application does not have a backend. This will be developed in the future.
